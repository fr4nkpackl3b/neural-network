# Neural network digit recogniton
Source code and training data for recognizing written digits The olcConsoleGameEngine.h created by javidx9 is required for this to work
The first line in the training data is the amount of uninterupted iterations the neural network should run for The second line is the layout of the neural network

The rest is the training data following this syntax:

//input data 1 //expected output data 1 //input data 2 //expected output data 2 //input data 3 //expected output data 3 ...
